In [part 1]({{< ref "/posts/get-a-marketing-job-in-tech-part-1" >}}) and [part 2]({{< ref "/posts/get-a-marketing-job-in-tech-part-2" >}}) we explored the different types of startups (consumer, enterprise, SMB etc.) and the various marketing roles. In part 3, we delve deeper into understanding the stages of a company and how your experience can vary significantly depending on the stage of the company you choose to work at. From early-stage startups to public companies, each stage offers unique opportunities and challenges.

### What kind of startup is right for you?

Startups are generally categorized into four stages based on their financing:

1. **Early stage**: No funding to series A
2. **Mid stage**: Series B and C
3. **Late stage/Pre-IPO**: Usually series D and above
4. **Public**: Combining Public and Pre-IPO here for simplicity

Having worked at various stages from founding to IPO across four different companies, I have developed a simple framework to help you navigate your career choices. This framework revolves around three pillars: Impact, Money, and Experience.

#### **Impact**

At this stage, your role significantly influences the company's survival and potential growth. Your daily contributions are vital, and you likely resonate with the company's mission, resulting in a fulfilling role.

#### **Experience**

This pillar focuses on your personal growth, enhancing your skills, knowledge, and building a network of mentors and peers. Working for a recognizable company at this stage can further propel your career.

#### **Money**

This aspect considers the financial rewards you can reap at different stages. While early-stage startups offer potential high rewards, they come with higher risks compared to pre-IPO and publicly traded companies.

### Understanding Different Stages

* **Early Stage Startups**: Ideal for those seeking a significant impact and willing to invest time and energy. Though the financial rewards might be less, the equity grants can be substantial, offering massive leverage as the company grows.
  
* **Mid Stage Startups**: Offers a balance between impact and financial stability. You can enjoy a broad role while being surrounded by mentors and peers who facilitate your growth.
  
* **Pre-IPO and Public Companies**: These companies are recognizable and offer a rich learning environment with developed functions and strong talent. They provide financial stability and liquidity, making them attractive for those prioritizing financial rewards.
